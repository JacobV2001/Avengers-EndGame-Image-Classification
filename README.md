## Overview

The **Endgame Image Classifier** is a machine learning project that classifies images of people based on their facial features and compares them to characters from the movie *Avengers: Endgame*. The goal is to determine which character an individual resembles the most using facial recognition and image classification techniques.

This project serves as both a fun lookalike tool and a learning platform for image classification and machine learning.It demonstrates key steps in creating an image classification pipeline, including data gathering, image processing, model training, and building a simple web interface for interaction

## Features

- **Lookalike Classification**: Upload an image, and the model predicts which *Avengers: Endgame* character you resemble the most.
- **SVM Model**: Uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for facial feature-based image classification.
- **Facial Feature Extraction**: Utilizes OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers to extract key facial features.
- **Local Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.
- **Web Scrapping Extraction**: Uses Selenlium to automade downloading of endgame character images.


## Skills Demonstrated
- **Machine Learning & Image Classification**: Gained experience with training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly in the context of image classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Image Processing**: Applied OpenCV to preprocess images for facial detection and feature extraction using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- **Data Collection & Web Scraping**: Automated the collection of images using Selenium for web scraping, creating a custom dataset for training the model.
- **Model Tuning & Hyperparameter Optimization**: Used techniques like grid search to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance.
- **Web Development**: Developed a local web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction with the model, making the application more accessible.
- **Version Control**: Utilized Git for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and project management throughout the development of the project.
- **Deployment & Hosting**: Gained insight into local server deployment using Flask and Python to create an interactive web-based application.

## Required Python libraries:
- `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models)
- `opencv-python` (for image processing)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting and visualization)
- `selenium` (for image scraping)
- `flask` (for the local web server)

You can install the necessary Python libraries by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset and Image Scraping

The dataset used to train the classifier was gathered by scraping images of *Avengers: Endgame* characters from Google Chrome Images. The image scraping process was automated using the `selenium` module.

### Image Scraping:
- The script searches for a list of *Avengers: Endgame* characters on Google Images.
- Using `selenium`, it automates the browser to load the image results and download images of the characters.
**Note: The image scraping process was performed for educational and research purpose only.**

### Image Preprocessing:
- Once images were downloaded, they were cropped to focus on the faces using facial detection with OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade Classifiers.

### Dataset Creation:
- After scraping and preprocessing, the images were labeled according to the character they represented.
- The dataset was then split into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

## How It Works

### Image Preprocessing:
- The first step is to process the uploaded image to detect any faces with two eyes using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Once a face is detected, the image is cropped to focus solely on the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) for better recognition accuracy.
  
### Feature Extraction:
- Facial landmarks are extracted from the cropped images using OpenCV.
- The extracted features (e.g., shading between eyes and other facial details) are used to create a feature vector that represents each face.

### Model Selection and Training:
- Grid search was used to tune the hyperparameters and find the best configuration for the model.
- The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm was selected based on performance with respect to the dataset.
- The dataset was split into **80% training** and **20% testing** data to evaluate the model's performance.

### Classification:
- After training, the SVM model is used to classify the uploaded image and predict which *Avengers: Endgame* character it most closely resembles.
- The model outputs the name of the character with the highest classification probability.


## Performance

The model achieved an accuracy of **89%** on the test dataset.
SVM Test Accuracy: 0.8923076923076924
